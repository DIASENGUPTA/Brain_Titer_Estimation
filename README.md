## Introduction
Brain Titer prediction is usually intrusive and only possible after medical inspection. This is an attempt to perform prediction of few of those titers using Deep Learning algorithms. 

## Brain Abeta Prediction
This attempts to improve performance of Abeta prediction by using Inception network and a VGG-inspired lighter convolution based network as backbone of GlobalLocal Transformer.

Train the models
'''
cd Brain\ Abeta\ Estimation/Abeta\ train
python GLT_train_test.py
'''

Validate the models
'''
cd Brain\ Abeta\ Estimation/Abeta\ train
python GLT_Trial_incep.py
python GLT_Trial_novel.py
